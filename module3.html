      <p> Willesden Green </p>
      
      <p>
        Moving to London was one of the most exciting events in my life. My first apartment
        was in Willesden Green, a sleepy area in the <span id = "northwest"> _________
        </span> of the city.
      </p>
      
      <p> Walking from the underground station with my suitcase, I noted the important elements
        of the neighborhood - a small supermarket, a couple of corner shops, a few small restaurants,
        and two bus stops between the underground station and my address. The <span id = "busLines">
          ______________________________ </span>  could take you to the central areas of London, like 
          Picadilly Circus.
      </p>
      
      <p> My apartment was in a small building on a side road, a few minutes away from the local high street. 
        It was on the third floor up steep steps in the corner, nothing but a square studio box with a few slanted walls 
        since it was right under the roof. It had all the necessities and a nice view out to the street, covered in trees, 
        the high street peeking in the corner if you looked closely. Unpacking the few things I had was quick but I wanted 
        to clean <span id="smallSpace"> __________________ </span> before I did that. It took me a few hours to polish the 
        place, making it look a bit less rustic, before I put away all my belongings and headed out to buy the necessities 
        for someone <span id="theirOwn"> __________________ </span> for the first time.
